<p><a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt">todo.txt</a> is a way of organizing your tasks by plain text files.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt-cli">todo.sh</a> is a way to manage such files from the command line.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">outline</code> is a extension to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">todo.sh</code> tool that converts outlines into the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">todo.txt</code> format, using indents to imply either dependency or inheritance
relationships.</p>

<p>For example, it converts this (sample.ol.txt):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(A)
  +project.whales
    write report on whales
      research phase
        reserve books about whales at the library
        read book 1
        read book 2

      complete analysis
        find data on whale migration patterns
        import data into computer
        do the magic

      write up findings

@buy
  (B)
    game console
    cables
    controller

  (C)
    television
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>into this (sample.todo.txt):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>(A) +project.whales reserve books about whales at the library; research phase; write report on whales
(B) @buy game console
(B) @buy cables
(B) @buy controller
(C) @buy television
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that tasks that are children of projects/contexts/priorities or a
combination of them inherit them.
Alternatively, tasks that are children of other tasks make them dependent.
In this case, the task ‘read book 1’ won’t show up in the todo file until the
‘reserve books…’ task is complete, and tasks under ‘complete analysis…’
won’t show up until all the research phase tasks are done.</p>

<p>This extends <code class="highlighter-rouge">todo.sh</code> to serve as an organizing tool for task breakdowns or
project management.</p>

<h1 id="updates">Updates</h1>

<p>A few additions have been made to the format of <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.ol.txt</code> files over time.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First is the divider: <code class="highlighter-rouge">---</code>.
Anything after the divider in an <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.ol.txt</code> file will be ignored.
This is space for notes and a scratchpad for the outline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Done tasks get collected into the global <code class="highlighter-rouge">done.txt</code> file in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">todo</code>
repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tasks now show their parenst in addition to themselves. This is to get around
the issue of multiple tasks that may have the same ‘raw’ text.
Take this outline file for example.</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Chemistry Essentials
   chapter 1-3 @read due:2029-02-20
   chapter 4-6 @read due:2029-03-05

Mathematics for adults
   chapter 1-3 @read due:2029-02-20
   chapter 4-6 @read due:2029-03-05
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>In this case, the tasks from the second book would marked as duplicates.
Instead, we store each task as follows, which ensures that each task has
unique raw text. It also gives some context to the task.</p>
    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>task text; &lt;parent task text&gt;; ... @&lt;contexts&gt;... +&lt;projects&gt;...
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>The information overload is a slight issue, but I find that I read the
beginning and ending of lines more closely that the middles, so it’s not much
of a problem.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="properly-deleting-tasks">Properly Deleting Tasks</h2>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" checked="checked" />when finishing tasks, if the task is archived before <code class="highlighter-rouge">outline</code> is run
    again, we are adding it back to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.todo.txt</code> file. This can be worked
    around for the time being by completing and removing tasks from both the
    <code class="highlighter-rouge">todo</code> file and the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ol</code> file at once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let us work on fixing this issue.  So what do we need to do? Whenever we
complete a task, if there is an outline file (<code class="highlighter-rouge">*.ol.txt</code>) for the todo file we
are editing, we need to propagate the change to the outline file.</p>

<p>Most, if not all of the time when working with outlines, we are not working on
our main todo file <code class="highlighter-rouge">todo.txt</code> but some other subject specific file, like
<code class="highlighter-rouge">learn.todo.txt</code>. To complete tasks in these files, we already have a custom
command <code class="highlighter-rouge">df</code>, that works like the default command <code class="highlighter-rouge">do</code>, but takes an additional
argument for the file to act on. So for example, if we want to complete task
number $4$ in <code class="highlighter-rouge">learn.todo.txt</code>, we can run <code class="highlighter-rouge">t df learn 4</code>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we have already stubbed out where we need to call into our <code class="highlighter-rouge">outline</code>
script. We will make a new subcommand called <code class="highlighter-rouge">__df</code> that we can hook into. It
will accept similar arguments as <code class="highlighter-rouge">df</code>, so borrowing from the previous example,
running <code class="highlighter-rouge">t df learn 4</code> will call <code class="highlighter-rouge">t outline __df learn.ol.txt 4</code>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">outline</code> works by keeping all the tasks in a local SQLite database. This is the
source of truth that we use to keep tasks in sync between outline files and text
files. So, the first thing we need to do is look up the task. One of the
invariants we rely on is that all tasks have a unique <code class="highlighter-rouge">raw</code> text. This is the
text of the task with all projects, contexts, due dates, etc. stripped away.</p>

<p>Once we’ve parsed out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">raw</code> text, we can set <code class="highlighter-rouge">completed = True</code> and sync
this task to the db. This is straigtforward since we already have a function
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sync_task</code> that takes care of most of the details. We simply parse the line in
of the todo file that we are interested in, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">sync_task</code> will look the task
by it’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">raw</code> text, and update the <code class="highlighter-rouge">completed</code> status.</p>

<p>Next, we need to sync the change to the outline file. We find the line in the
outline that that has the matching <code class="highlighter-rouge">raw</code> text and mark it as complete. After
flushing out some bugs, it seems like everything is working now.</p>
