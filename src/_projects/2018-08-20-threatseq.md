ThreatSEQ is a security tool built at Battelle for the Gene Synthesis industry to screen orders for threatening
sequences. It offers an API for Gene Synthesis companies to send incoming orders to, and an interface where they can
view the assigned threat tier, alignments, and curated metadata for submitted sequences. 

- The International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC) is industry-led group of gene synthesis companies
  formed to design and apply a common protocol to screen the sequences of synthetic gene orders and the customers who
  place them. Battelle was accepted into the IGSC by achieving a perfect score on set of standardized sequences that the
  IGSC uses to vet prospective members, and is part of a working group focused on red teaming the biosecurity protocol.

- ThreatSEQ was included on a proposal from Harvard's Church Lab to the IARPA Molecular Information Storage (MIST)
  Program. ThreatSeq's portion of the proposal, worth $3 million, is to provide a service to screen DNA for potentially
  dangerous sequences prior to synthesis. The goals of the MIST program start at synthesizing 10Mb of data, up to 1TB,
  in the span of 24 hours.

- Completed industry trials with two industry members, and currently engaged in negotiating a
  pilot-to-sale with a first customer.

- Selected as a finalist for the U.S. Department Of Energy R&D 100 Awards.

- Collaborating with Harvard's Church Lab, the International Genetically Engineered Machine (IGEM)
  Foundation, and others to red team ThreatSEQ and identify novel types of threatening sequences.
