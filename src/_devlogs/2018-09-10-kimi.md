### KInematics Modeling Interface

Kimi is a tool to model the kinematics of biological reactions. It is a stochastic model based on Gillespie simulations,
parametrized by a set of reactions, initial conditions and external stimuli.

- **Stack**: Haskell, React, D3

**TODO:**

- split up graphs by molecule
- save parameters and pathways into projects
- upload existing fluorescence data to connect with reaction rates
- tweak parameters in real-time on system in stable state
