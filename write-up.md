# ThreatSEQ

ThreatSEQ is a security tool for the Gene Synthesis industry to screen orders for threatening sequences. It offers an
API for Gene Synthesis companies to send incoming orders to, and an interface where they can view the assigned threat
tier, alignments, and curated metadata for submitted sequences. 

- The International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC) is industry-led group of gene synthesis companies
  formed to design and apply a common protocol to screen the sequences of synthetic gene orders and the customers who
  place them. Battelle was accepted into the IGSC by achieving a perfect score on set of standardized sequences that the
  IGSC uses to vet prospective members, and is part of a working group focused on red teaming the biosecurity protocol.
- ThreatSEQ was included on a proposal from Harvard's Church Lab to the IARPA Molecular Information Storage (MIST)
  Program. ThreatSeq's portion of the proposal, worth $3 million, is to provide a service to screen DNA for potentially
  dangerous sequences prior to synthesis. The goals of the MIST program start at synthesizing 10Mb of data, up to 1TB,
  in the span of 24 hours.
- Completed industry trials with Synthetic Genomics and Twist Bioscience, and currently engaged in negotiating a
  pilot-to-sale with Twist Bioscience.
- Selected as a finalist for the U.S. Department Of Energy R\&D 100 Awards.
- Collaborating with Harvard's Church Lab, the International Genetically Engineered Machine (IGEM)
  Foundation, and others to red team ThreatSEQ and identify novel types of threatening sequences.

# Kimi - KInematics Modeling Interface

Kimi is a tool to model the kinematics of biological reactions. It is a Stochastic model based on Gillespie simulations,
parametrized by a set of reactions, initial conditions and external stimuli.


# Stash.ai

Stash is an intelligent bookmarking tool that uses machine learning to automatically categorize web content, allowing
users to rediscover content in meaningful ways. Stash is cross-platform; users can save links on the web with a browser
extension and save content from apps on their phone using the "share" menu.

- Raised seed funding from Dorm Room Fund ($20k) and Rough Draft Ventures ($40k).
- Obtained 40,000 wait-list sign-ups in the first few weeks after launch, and over 50,000 users in the first few months.
- Received press coverage from  TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Lifehacker, Fast Co., and others. 
- Winners of the Fast Co. 2017 Innovation By Design award.
