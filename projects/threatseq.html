          <p>ThreatSEQ is a security tool built at Battelle for the Gene Synthesis industry to screen orders for threatening
sequences. It offers an API for Gene Synthesis companies to send incoming orders to, and an interface where they can
view the assigned threat tier, alignments, and curated metadata for submitted sequences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The International Gene Synthesis Consortium (IGSC) is industry-led group of gene synthesis companies
formed to design and apply a common protocol to screen the sequences of synthetic gene orders and the customers who
place them. Battelle was accepted into the IGSC by achieving a perfect score on set of standardized sequences that the
IGSC uses to vet prospective members, and is part of a working group focused on red teaming the biosecurity protocol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ThreatSEQ was included on a proposal from Harvard’s Church Lab to the IARPA Molecular Information Storage (MIST)
Program. ThreatSeq’s portion of the proposal, worth $3 million, is to provide a service to screen DNA for potentially
dangerous sequences prior to synthesis. The goals of the MIST program start at synthesizing 10Mb of data, up to 1TB,
in the span of 24 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaborating with Harvard’s Church Lab, the International Genetically Engineered Machine (IGEM) Foundation, and
others to red team ThreatSEQ and identify novel types of threatening sequences.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completed industry trials with industry members, and now serving multiple customers, including some of the largest
Gene Synthesis companies in the world.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chosen as one of the top 100 new products of the year in the <a href="https://www.battelle.org/insights/newsroom/news-details/2021/09/09/battelle-receives-r-d-100-award-for-biosecurity-risk-detection-service">2018 U.S. Department Of Energy R&amp;D 100 Awards</a>.</p>
